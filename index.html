    <h1>Nonsense</h1>
    <p>Make sure you have potatos in every meal</p>
    <p>For they're versatile and oh so fulfilling.</p>
    <p> In soups and stews, they'll make a hearty feel,</p>   
    <p> And mashed or fried, they'll make your taste buds thrilling.</p>
    <p> Hunted by pineapples</p>
    <p>Don't you think desserts are too sweet</p>
<p>
      Sweet, sweet, everywhere we look,<br>
      A sugar rush in every cook.<br>
      Cakes and cookies, pies galore,<br>
      So much sugar, I can't take anymore!
    </p>
    <p>
      Don't you think desserts are too sweet,<br>
      A sugar high, but nothing to eat.<br>
      Candies, chocolates, and sugary treats,<br>
      Too much sugar, it just can't be beat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then we take a step back,<br>
      And realize, that sugar's actually packed.<br>
      With flavor, joy, and endless delight,<br>
      A small indulgence, worth it every night.
